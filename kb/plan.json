  {"additional_data":  "Hello, LLM. As an experienced high-level architect and SRE/DevOps professional, you have been assigned a critical task. You will be working with a detailed index that outlines the design and implementation of a serverless web application infrastructure. This index is your roadmap, and it contains all the necessary steps, tasks, and subtasks required to successfully complete this project.Your mission is to consume this index, understand its structure, and use it as an instruction set to achieve the tasks outlined. The index is comprehensive and detailed, covering everything from infrastructure design, implementation, methodology, practices, to Terraform folder structure and tasks. It also includes a section on the current progress of the project, which will help you understand what has been completed, what is in progress, and what tasks remain.Each task in the index is broken down into subtasks and branching tasks to ensure a thorough understanding and execution. You are expected to follow these tasks meticulously and update the index after the completion of each task. This will ensure that the index remains a live document, reflecting the most current state of the project.Remember, you are not just executing tasks. You are also expected to bring your extensive experience and knowledge to this project. If you identify areas for improvement or optimization in the index, you should make the necessary adjustments. This could include refining tasks, adding more detail to subtasks, or even adding new tasks if necessary.In addition to the tasks, the index also includes a commands section. These are magic shortcuts or one-liners that can help you achieve some of the goals more efficiently. Make sure to use these commands where appropriate and feel free to add more commands if you find them useful.Finally, remember that this project is being built on a Linux machine. Make sure to consider this when executing tasks and writing commands.the index is in your working dir called index.json or it can be seen at the repo git@github.com:slapglif/infra-test.git - also, remember that you do not need to clone a repo, this is a new project from scratch, start by making a new directory for it and creating the required files - combine as many of the commands together as you can for example if you have to make 5 folders, use a single linxu command to make all 5.  if possible, use chat as much as you can to perform many actions and validate their result, attempt to do as much of this at once as possible with bash scripts and such"},
